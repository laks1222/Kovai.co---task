# Notebook Fallback Links (NBViewer)

If GitHub rendering does not work properly, use the following NBViewer links to view the notebooks:

## 📌 Insights Notebook
[**Open Kovai.co - Insights.ipynb on NBViewer**](https://nbviewer.org/github/laks1222/Kovai.co---task/blob/main/Kovai.co%20-%20Insights.ipynb)

## 📌 Forecast Notebook
[**Open kovai.co - Forecast.ipynb on NBViewer**](https://nbviewer.org/github/laks1222/Kovai.co---task/blob/main/kovai.co%20-%20Forecast.ipynb)

Both links will always work even if GitHub fails to render the `.ipynb` files.
